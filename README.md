# Tool Guides

This project contains several guides / examples / tutorials for different technologies.

Each technology has a folder and a `README.md` file with a short explanation of the contents; further `README` files might be contained in deeper folders. Altogether, all examples and blueprints constitute a set of re-usable templates. However, they are collected in a non-ordered fashion and as an on-going project, which is completed step by step whenever I have time to re-format and re-structure old material of stuff I learned long ago.
