# Templates

This project contains several templates / examples / tutorials for different technologies:

- CMake
- OpenCV
- PCL
- Python
- C++
- ...

Each technology has a folder and a README file with a short explanation of the contents; further READMEs might be contained in deeper folders. Altogether, all examples and blueprints constitute a set of re-usable templates. However, they are collected in a non-ordered fashion and as an on-going project, which completed step by step whenever I have time to re-format and re-structure old material of stuff I learned long ago.
