# TriMesh User Guide

> [Trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) is a pure Python 3.7+ library for loading and using triangular meshes with an emphasis on watertight surfaces. The goal of the library is to provide a full featured and well tested Trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in the Shapely library.

The majority of examples and models used in this tutorial come from the official documentation.

## Installation

```bash
# Standard installation
pip install trimesh

# Full installation, i.e., full experience with all the packages
