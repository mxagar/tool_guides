# TriMesh User Guide

> [Trimesh](https://github.com/mikedh/trimesh) is a pure Python 3.7+ library for loading and using triangular meshes with an emphasis on watertight surfaces. The goal of the library is to provide a full featured and well tested Trimesh object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis, in the style of the Polygon object in the Shapely library.

The majority of examples and models used in this tutorial come from the official documentation.

## Installation

```bash
# Standard installation
pip install trimesh

# Full installation, i.e., full experience with all the packages
pip install trimesh[all]
```

## TriMesh Guide

The notebook [`TriMesh.ipynb`](TriMesh.ipynb) has the following sections:

**1. Quickstart**
2. Section
3. Colors
4. Texture
5. Rays and Intersections
6. Nearest Points
7. Curvature Measurement

In the following, the contents of the first section (the most useful and important) are shown:

```python

```

## Viewer

> - mouse click + drag rotates the view
> - ctl + mouse click + drag pans the view
> - mouse wheel zooms
> - z returns to the base view
> - w toggles wireframe mode
> - c toggles backface culling
> - g toggles an XY grid with Z set to lowest point
> - a toggles an XYZ-RGB axis marker between: off, at world frame, or at every frame and world, and at every frame
> - f toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode
> - m maximizes the window
> - q closes the window
