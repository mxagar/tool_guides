# Gradio

This guide contains my notes on the basic functionalities of [Gradio](). I created the notes after following the [Hugging Face Bootcamp by JM Portilla, Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-hugging-face-bootcamp). I have further notes on more ML/model-related topics referrng to Haggig Face at [mxagar/tool_guides/hugging_face](https://github.com/mxagar/tool_guides/tree/master/hugging_face).

Notes:

- I am adding modified versions of the notebooks used in the bootcamp. I tried to find the original repository to fork it, but unfortunately I didn't find it.
- The slides are public and accessible under [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPNewt6K68qdwYq5bGAauBVjjx0Mr-zz](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPNewt6K68qdwYq5bGAauBVjjx0Mr-zz).
