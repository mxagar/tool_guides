# Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals - Coursera

This repository contains the notes I made when following this Specialization offered in Coursera by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Prof. Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider):

[Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals)

This Coursera Specialization is divided into 3 courses, each one contained in a specific folder:

1. [Object Oriented Data Structures in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1?specialization=cs-fundamentals): `01_OOP`

    - Classes: encapsulation
    - Memory model: pointers (*, &), heap (persistent / low), stack (non-persistent / high)
    - Links/aliases: &
    - Scope (blocks)
    - Classes: types of constructors & destructor
    - Templates

2. [Ordered Data Structures in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-2?specialization=cs-fundamentals): `02_Ordered_DS`

    - A
    - B

3. [Unordered Data Structures in C++](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-3?specialization=cs-fundamentals): `03_Unordered_DS`

    - A
    - B
