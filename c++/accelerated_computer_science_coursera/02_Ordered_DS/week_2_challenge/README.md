# Ordered Data Structures: Week 2 Challenge Instructions

Your job is to implement the function `int count(Node *n)` that computes and returns the number of nodes in the binary tree that has `n` as its root.

When you write your code below, assume that a class type called `Node` has already been defined for you; you cannot change the class definition. This class type has two child pointers (`left` , `right`). There is also a constructor `Node()` that initializes the children to `nullptr` and a destructor that deallocates the subtree's memory recursively.
