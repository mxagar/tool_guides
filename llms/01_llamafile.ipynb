    "> `llamafile` lets you turn large language model (LLM) weights into executables. Say you have a set of LLM weights in the form of a 4GB file (in the commonly-used GGUF format). With llamafile you can transform that 4GB file into a binary that runs on six OSes without needing to be installed.\n",

    "- **Running llamafile with external weights**: \n",
