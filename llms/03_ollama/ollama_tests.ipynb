      "The sky appears to be blue due to a particular phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This happens when the molecules in the Earth's atmosphere scatter short-wavelength light, such as blue and violet light, to a greater extent than longer wavelengths like red or yellow. However, our eyes are more sensitive to blue light and less sensitive to violet light, so the sky appears blue rather than violet to us. Additionally, sunlight reaches us most strongly in the blue part of the spectrum, making it the most prevalent color present in daylight. Therefore, under typical daytime conditions, we perceive the sky as blue.\n",

      "Yes, the color of the sky can indeed vary from blue to white or gray. This variation depends on several factors. One primary factor is the presence and amount of water vapor, pollutants, or other particles in the atmosphere. For example, when there are many particles or pollutants, such as during haze, fog, or smog, the sky can appear more white or gray. Additionally, at sunrise or sunset, when the sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere at a lower angle, the longer wavelengths (red and orange) get scattered more effectively than the shorter blue wavelengths, which can result in an orange, red, or pink hue for the sky, while the direct sunlight appears white.\n",
