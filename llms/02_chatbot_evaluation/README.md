# Chatbot Evaluation

I created a simple chatbot evaluation package which can be used to score chatbots using a dataset of predefined and rated chat sessions.

I moved the package to its own repository: [chatbot_evaluation](https://github.com/mxagar/chatbot_evaluation).

Also, consider libraries like [RAGAS](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/getstarted/index.html).
