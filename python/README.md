# Python Guide and Examples

A summary/guide of the Python programming language is provided in

[`python_manual.txt`](python_manual.txt)

Note that in that file I don't follow the Markdown format, but a personal style with indentations which I use for private documentation purposes.

Additionally, the current folder contains other python templates/examples related to other libraries or guides:

- `pybind`: examples for binding C++ code/binaries to python 
	- `pybind_example_00`: simple example based on the sample written by Alvaro; unfortunately, I am having some issues with it, probably related to my Anaconda distribution and my environments
- `automate`: examples from the course/tutorial/book by Al Sweigart ["Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"](https://www.udemy.com/course/automate/).
- `export_conda_envs.sh`
- ... :construction:

Finally, the following repository collects many other aspects related to software engineering with Python:
