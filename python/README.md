# Python Templates

This project contains python templates/examples created after following two courses/books:

- `automate`: Automate Boring Stuff with Python: focus on general handling libraries
    - general python use
    - web scrapping
    - file I/O (XLSX, JSON, etc)
- `data_sciene`: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp: focus on data analysis
    - numpy
    - matplotlib
    - pandas
    - seaborn
    - ...
- `pybind`: examples for binding C++ code/binaries to python 
	- `pybind_example_00`: simple example based on the sample written by Alvaro; unfortunately, I am having some issues with it, probably related to my Anaconda distribution and my environments


The summary of all courses is in the file `python_manual.txt`
