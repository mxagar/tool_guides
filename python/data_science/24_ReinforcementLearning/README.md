# Reinforcement Learning Notebooks

I made these notebooks following the Udemy course by Jos√© Portilla **Practical AI with Python and Reinforcement Learning**.

In addition to the notebooks here, this course reviews concepts related to:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Machine Learning concepts
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Keras: ANNs and CNNs
