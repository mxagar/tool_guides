# Python for Data Science

This project contains notebooks written while following the Udemy course
Python for Data Sciene and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Jos√© Portilla), 
and many additional courses, tutorials and books.

Important related `howto` files of mine are:

- `~/Dropbox/Documentation/howtos/pybullet_openai_guide.txt`
- `~/Dropbox/Documentation/howtos/python_reinforcement_learning_openai.txt`

To use these notebooks, try the following environments
```bash
conda env list
source activate udemy_python_course
source activate 3d
source activate python-cvcourse
source activate pyfinance
```

Alternatively, you need to create your own environment and install the necessary packages:
```bash
# TBD
```
