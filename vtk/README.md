# VTK Python Guide

This folder contains examples on the powerful visualization toolkit VTK.

These examples were taken from the official site

[https://examples.vtk.org/site/](https://examples.vtk.org/site/)

To install VTK (in a Python environment):

```bash
pip install vtk
```

:warning: **WARNING**: I think [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/) is a more *pythonic* package for the same purpose and which also is based in VTK.

If I find time, I will add a small starter guide in here: [[mxagar/tool_guides/pyvista](https://github.com/mxagar/tool_guides/tree/master/pyvista).
