# Hugging Face Bootcamp Notes

This guide contains my notes on the [Hugging Face Bootcamp by JM Portilla, Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-hugging-face-bootcamp).

If you are looking for a quick start guide focusing on NLP, please look at [`../README.md`](../README.md); instead, if you'd like to get a broader overview, this is your part/section.

Notes:

- I am adding modified versions of the notebooks used in the bootcamp. I tried to find the original repository to fork it, but unfortunately I didn't find it.
- The slides are public and accessible under [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPNewt6K68qdwYq5bGAauBVjjx0Mr-zz](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KPNewt6K68qdwYq5bGAauBVjjx0Mr-zz).
