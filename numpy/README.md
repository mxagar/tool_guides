# Numpy

[Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html) is the go-to library when you'd like to use arrays in Python. It's implemented in C, so it's very fast, and easy to use. But which are the best practices? I'll try answer that question in this guide.

I follow the official documentation: [NumPy user guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html).

Altogether, 3 notebooks are contained in here, with the following contents:

- [`01_UserTutorial.ipynb`](01_UserTutorial.ipynb): complete (beginner-intermmediate) tutorial based on [NumPy quickstart](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html).
- [`02_Advanced.ipynb`](02_Advanced.ipynb): more advanced or deepened topics picked from [NumPy fundamentals](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.html)
- [`03_PerformanceTests.ipynb`](03_PerformanceTests.ipynb): personal performance and other tests.

So select the topic and open the corresponding notebook.
