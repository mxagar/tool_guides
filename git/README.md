# Git Guide

The collocated file [`git_howto.txt`](./git_howto.txt) compiles a set of git commands I have collected over the years. It is not a Markdown, but instead as a TXT with indentations that structure the contents hierarchically.

Additionally, I have also created a summary of the most common git commands and workflows during teamwork, such as the *fork-branch-merge* workflow: [`git_teams_summary.md`](./git_teams_summary.md).

For more detailed explanations on how to use git in teams (with images), check: [Version Control in Teams](https://github.com/mxagar/mlops_udacity/blob/main/01_Clean_Code/MLOpsND_CleanCode.md#3-lesson-3-working-with-others-using-version-control).
