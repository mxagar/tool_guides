This magnetic field is invisible, but it exerts a force on other objects made of certain materials, like iron or steel. \\n\\nInside a magnet, there are tiny particles called electrons that move around in a specific way, creating the magnetic field. When two magnets are brought close together, their magnetic fields interact with each other. Depending on how the magnets are oriented, they can either attract each other (pull together) or repel each other (push apart). \\n\\nThis attraction or repulsion is due to the alignment of the electrons in the two magnets. When the electrons in the two magnets line up in a certain way, they create a stronger magnetic force between the magnets. When the electrons are aligned in opposite directions, they create a weaker force or even repel each other. \\n\\nSo in simple terms, magnets work by creating a magnetic field that interacts with other magnetic materials, either attracting or repelling them based on the alignment of their electrons.'}"

The vertices in the diagram correspond to the interaction terms in the Lagrangian, and the lines represent the propagators of the particles involved in the interaction. The direction of the lines represents the flow of momentum and energy.\\n\\nBy calculating the Feynman diagrams for a given process, one can determine the probability amplitude for that process to occur. The probability amplitude is then squared to obtain the probability of the interaction taking place. Feynman diagrams allow us to visualize and calculate complex particle interactions in a systematic and intuitive way.\\n\\nOverall, Feynman diagrams provide a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of particles in quantum field theory, and they have been instrumental in the development of the Standard Model of particle physics.'}"
