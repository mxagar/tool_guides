# OpenCV Templates in Python

This folder contains OpenCV templates in python.
The Jupyter notebooks were created after following the Udemy course [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) by Jos√© Portilla.

These are informal tests while following the course (informal, because I had already experience with the functionalities tested in them, so the code is non exhaustive, rather smaller tests):
- `02_Numpy_Basics.ipynb`
- `03_Images_with_OpenCV.ipynb`
- `04_Image_Processing.ipynb`

The following notebooks/folders contain more formally formated material:
- `05_Video_Basics.ipynb`
- `06_Object_Detection.ipynb`
- `07_Object_Tracking`
- `08_Keras_Deep_Learning`
- `09_Capstone_Project`

The `.py` scripts contain snippets for most common OpenCV functions.

Important related `howto` files (not public) of mine are (for my personal tracking):

- `~/Dropbox/Learning/PythonLab/python_manual.txt`
- `~/Dropbox/Documentation/howtos/sklearn_scipy_sympy_stat_guide.txt`
