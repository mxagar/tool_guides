# Artificial Neural Networks with Tensorflow

This folder contains tutorial notebooks on Tensorflow & Keras, from the basic to intermediate level.

They were mainly created after following these Udemy courses:

- [Python for Data Sciene and Machine Learning Bootcamp (by José Marcial Portilla)](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)
- [Complete Tensorflow 2 and Keras Deep Learning Bootcamp (by José Marcial Portilla)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-tensorflow-2-and-keras-deep-learning-bootcamp/)
- [Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning (by José Marcial Portilla)](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/)

Unfortunately, sometimes I have not found a repository to fork, so the attribution is done in this README.

The aforementioned courses are very practical, they don't focus so much on the theory; for that purpose, I used:
- "An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R", by James et al. A repository with python notebooks can be found in [https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python).
- "Computer Vision" by Szeliski.
- "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop. A repository with python notebooks can be found in [https://github.com/ctgk/PRML](https://github.com/ctgk/PRML).

The notebooks on CNNs using Keras are the same as in the following repository/folder:

`git_repositories/templates/opencv/python/08_Keras_Deep_Learning`.

Note that in some cases I also just simply followed the documentation provided in the websites of the used packages.

Important related `howto` files (not public) of mine are (for my personal tracking):

- `~/Dropbox/Learning/PythonLab/python_manual.txt`
- `~/Dropbox/Documentation/howtos/sklearn_scipy_sympy_stat_guide.txt`
- `~/Dropbox/Documentation/howtos/keras_tensorflow_guide.txt`
