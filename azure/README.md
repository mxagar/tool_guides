## 2. Cloud Computing and Its Benefits

*There is no cloud, it's always some else's computer what we're using.*

Azure has 1000+ services, all accessible from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) (create account); we can click on **create a resource** to see some of these services:

- Virtual Machine
- Web App: a web application in which the VM is already set up and we care only about the web app
- Function app: we can just write the function in the UI and that's it; for small pieces of code for light tasks run frequently.
- Logic app: connection 2 application together, if an event happens, trigger one or the other, etc.
- ...

![Azure Resources Panel](./assets/azure_resources_panel.png)

If we want to find something, we should type it in the **search space**!

There are **Categories**:

- AI + Machine Learning: Chatbots, NLP, CV, Custom ML service, ...
- Analytics:
  - Azure Machine Learning: custom ML service
  - Azure Synapse Analytics: Data Warehouse
  - ...
- Compute: Containers, Container Registries, Kubernetes, Quantum Computing, ...
- Databases: SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra

Even tools not supported officially by Microsoft are provided by 3rd party vendors, e.g., Oracle (Linux, DB, etc.).

There is a **Marketplace**, where 3rd party vendors offer their cloud products:

- Ubuntu server
- Wordpress app service
- ...

### Shared Responsibility Model

An app requires many hardware and software components, and depending on how everything is set up, the reponsibilities of each of the components vary; that's the [shared responsibility model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility):

- If we have everything on premises, the responsibility is completely of the customer/user.
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): VM Responsibility: everything starting at the OS is the user's responsibility.
- PaaS (Platform): App Service Responsibility (e.g., Web App): the OS becomes resposibility of the coud provider, i.e., Azure. Depending on the app, some component resposibilities might be shared. 
- SaaS (Software): Cloud Respnsibility (e.g., O365): the user is responsible of the components starting at the credentials.

![VM Responsibility](./assets/vm-responsibility.jpg)

![Shared Responsibility Model](./assets/shared-responsibility.svg)

### Types of Clouds

- Public cloud: available to anyone who wants to purchase them.
  - E.g., Azure; Azure owns the HW and offers the services.
- Private cloud: privately owned HW & setup; we need to be invited.
  - Government cloud, etc.
  - Azure also offers private clouds! It looks like the regular Azure cloud, but the customer either owns or leases exclusive access to the HW.
- Hybrid cloud: combination of both.
  - One deprecated example were the SQL DBs that had a local instance but which could scale in the cloud, i.e., Stretch DB.

Obviously, privacy is best in the private cloud.

### Cloud Pricing

Downsides of paying for cloud services:

- Difficult to predict monthly bill
- Difficult to understand what a service will cost
- Possibility of big savings, but no predictability

Factors of a service price, e.g., of a VM:

- Region
- OS
- Do we have a license?
- Instance size
- Disk size
- Bandwidth
- Backup
- Reservation
- Support

Factors of a service price, e.g., of a DB, concretely Cosmos DB:

- API
- Region
- Serverless?
- Ops/sec
- Storage
- Gateway?
- Backup?

Some services are free!

Most commonly we are charged

- by time (second-precission, but price is by hour)
- for storage space (~2 cent/GB/month)
- network traffic
- for operations (read, write, list, delete, query) - usually very cheap per op

Pricing Calculartor: [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/)

- Basic VM instance prices show, without storage, etc.
- We can also add the services we need for our app to the cart and check their price; however, it's an estimation, because usage factors also affect the price depending on the app's components.

### Benefits of Cloud Computing

In a nutshell:

- High availability
- Scalability
- Elasticity
- Reliability
- Predictability
- Security
- Governance
- Manageability

#### High Availability

High Availability = Uptime; high availability is a conscious effort to avoid downtime.

- Maximum: 100% = 365 days, 24/7; however, all cloud providers have some downtimes (sometimes for seconds).
- Ability of a system to remain operational to users during planned/unplanned outages.
- Planned outages are inevitable:
  - To updated applications
  - OS security patches
  - HW replacement
  - Migrations
- Unplanned outages are also inevitable
  - HW failure
  - NW disruptions
  - Power outages
  - Natural disasters
  - Cyber attacks
  - SW bugs
  - Poor architecture

Methods to mitigate planned outages:

- Gradual deployment: deploy 1 server, then 10, then 100
  - Test and monitor deployments
- Easy rollback plans: Azure has some tools for that, but the app needs to be constructed taking that into account
- Small deployments
- Frequent deplyments; because we become expertrs
- Automation: CICD

Methods to mitigate unplanned outages:

- Components have redundancy
- Use Azure's built-in features
  - Availability sets
  - Availability zones
  - Cross-region load balancing
- Health monitoring
- Automation
- Strong security, to prevent hackers
- Be geographically distributed (due to natural disasters)
- Have a disaster recovery plan and test it!
  - Can I have my systems running again in 20 mins?
- Load testing: in case we have a popular app, test scaling and load

#### Scalability

Scalability = ability of a system to accomodate increasing demand by adding or removing resources as needed.

- We adapt to changing traffic volume without any changes in the code or in the system design.
- Example of punctual traffic fluctuations
  - E-commerce on Black Friday
  - School registrations in September
  - ...

There are different types of scalings:

- Vertical:
  - Adding more resources to a single server: more memory, number of CPUs, etc.
  - Called *scale up* or *scale down*
  - There is an upper limit!
  - Largest server in Azure: 96 vCPUs, 384 GB memory
  - It does not improve the availability
- Horizontal
  - Adding more servers
  - Called *scale out* or *scale in*
  - No limits: number of servers, regions... we can scale in any direction
  - We have additional complexities for load balancing
  - It improves the systems availability

Impact on system cost:

- Cost increases linearly with the amount of resources
- However, we can control our **maximum capacity** on the system easily, so we spend only th emoney we need to spend!

#### Elasticity

Ability of a system to **quickly and easily** scale up/down:

- It needs to be automated: *autoscaling*; metrics are monitored (e.g., CPU usage) and scaling is managed, by modifying the **capacity**.
- *Waste* resources are minimized: systems that are paid for and not used; in non-cloud environments, waste is much larger.

#### Reliability

A high quality service should be:

- Available: accessible to the users when they need it.
- Reliable: system performs as intended without interruption.
  - We want to trust the system, which also requires transparency.
  - Autoscaling is related to the reliability.
  - Multiple-regions are also related to reliability.
  - Backups.
  - Health probes.
- Predictable

#### Predictability

Ability to forecasr and control performance and behaviour of a system:

- We have the confidence the system will work.
- How is the predictability achieved?
  - Autoscaling
  - Load balancing
  - Different instance types
  - Cost management
  - API
  - Pricing calculators

#### Security

Coud providers are massive targets for hackers. Thus, the providers spend a lot of money to be secure. Among others:

- They follow standard compliance certifications.
- They go through audits.
- They provide the users with tools to assure security (for apps and data).
- There is an always-on DDoS (Denial of service attack).
- There is a Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).
- They have always up-to-date platform services.
- Encryption by default.
- There are many Azure tools to enhance our security, like Firewalls, etc.


#### Governance

Governance is about how the organization does business and how that is related to the cloud services, i.e., how these services interact with the business processes. It involves the definition, implementation and monitoring of the policies that shape that business-cloud interaction.

Examples:

- The company wants that given policies/measures are followed in the cloud.
- Basic auditing and reporting is required.
- Sometimes some standard compliance is required: GDPR, etc.

How is governance achieved?

- Azure Policy & Blueprint: we can add taging, metadata, etc.
- Management groups: we can have management of different subscriptions.
- Custom roles: we define roles with accesses to certain resources.
- Soft delete: some data is sent to the trash, instead of deleting it (avoid accidental deletes).
- Guides on best practices are provided.

#### Manageability

Management **of** the cloud and **in** the cloud. The *of* part is achieved by:

- Templates
- Automation
- Scaling: autoscaling is possible for many resources.
- Monitoring and alerts: notify resource status, traffic, etc.
- Self-healing

In the case of the managenet *in* the cloud, we achieve it with:

- Web portal
- CLI & scripts
- Cloud Shell: in the we UI
- APIs
- Powershell

## 3. Cloud Service Types

The term **I/P/S as a Service**:

- It refers to something we could buy, but instead, we rent it.
- If we wish, we don't need to commit to a given volume/amount; but we can, so prices are cheaper.
- We pay for what we use.
- The cloud provider is responsible for maintenance & Co.

There are primarily three types of cloud services, as introduced in the shared responsibility model:

- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) - VMs
  - Usually, consists of real-world elements we could have on our data center, no abstracted products.
  - Essential services: computing, storage, networking
  - Example: Virtual Machines
    - We pay them by the second
    - We can choose different sizes
  - Example: Azure Storage
    - 5 PB capacity
    - Very cheap
    - Can handle blobs, files, queues, tables, etc.
    - Can be configured as a data lake.
  - Example: Virtual Networks
    - No cost, but we do have bandwidth cost
- PaaS (Platform) - Heroku / Docker container
  - A layer on top of IaaS: middleware, development tools, DB server, etc.
  - Example: Azure App Service
    - We upload code and configuration to Azure, and it runs without needing to configure the VM undereath
    - CI/CD included
  - Example: Managed Storage - Azure SQL Database
    - We don't have to worry about the server, the VM, disk space, etc.
  - Example: Azure Front Door / Load Balancer / Firewall
- SaaS (Software) - Apps / O365 / GDrive
  - App is ready to be used.

### Serverless

It has become a *buzz word*: it is effectively another pricing model in which we pay for service, not for renting the HW. But of course there are servers behind!

We don't pick the HW, concretely, but some size/compute capacity:

- Examples of *non-serverless* payment for SQL DBs:
  - DTU for Azure SQL DB (Data Transaction Unit): we can choose a DTU number withs corresponding price
  - vCORE for Azure SQL DBs: in this case it is related to the number of CPU cores, and the larger the vCORE, the larger the price
- Examples of *serveless* payment model: we don't have a table to choose the size/compute!
  - Azure takes care of the necessary scaling and we pay, for instance, for CPU second.

The advantage of servlerless is that if we don't use the service, we don't pay for it! However, **the price is not predicteble!**

Serverless services:

- Functions
- Container Apps
- Kubernetes
- SQL DB
- Cosmos DB

## 4. Core Architectural Components

### Regions, Region Pairs, Sovereign Regions

Regions:

- Areas of the world where MS has at least 3 data centers
- Currently 60 world-wide, but we not always can use all of them (e.g., sometimes we need to live in the region, etc.)
- Not necessarily countries, but can be; some countries have multiple regions
- Each region has a **region pair**, to which the connection is the fastest
  - We should use that pair for backups, etc.

[2D/3D Azure Infrastructure Map](https://datacenters.microsoft.com/globe/explore)

![Azure Infrastructure Map](./assets/azure_infra_map.jpg)

- Light blue dots: regions
- High speed connections under the see displayed
- US has 9 regions (this can be modified)
- New coming regions are gray dots

Example: Canada:

- It has 2 regions: Central & East
- Data stored in these regions never leaves Canada; **however, that't not always like that**: Brazil has also a region, but the data leaves to the US. In fact, Brazil has a one-way pair to a US region.
- Anyone can use these regions
- These Canadian regions form a pair; as mentioned, each region has usually a pair - the exception is Qatar, which has a region *without* a pair.

Every time we create a resource, we need to choose a region, and that affects the price.

#### Sovereign Regions

They are connected to a country/government. They are not connected to the Azure Public Cloud, and we need an approval to use them. They use different compliance standards. Many details of these sovereign regions are undisclosed.

For instance, in the US:

- We have the Azure Commencial / Public Cloud
- But also other clouds:
  - Azure Government
  - Azure Government Secret: Secret operations (military)
  - Azure Government Top Secret

The Chinese Government has also Azure Sovereign Region(s).

### Availability Zones (AZ) and Data Centers

Availability Zones = physically separate locations within each Azure region. So we have several data centers connected with really high speed cables (5 ms delay):

- They have their own separate building
- Their own connection to the internet
- Their own power supply
- They don't rely on each other

**IMPORTANT**:

- Not all regions have availability zones; that requires having several data centers! If we are interested on deploying on a region with availability zones, we need to see which ones offer that.
- Not all services support availability zones, although most do.

![Availability Zones](./assets/azure_availability_zones.jpg)

We have 3 types of Azure Zone Services:

- Zonal Services
  - You choose to deploy to a specific Availability Zone
  - You should duplicate services in other zones
  - Example: VMs
- Zone-Redundant Services
  - We don't worry about the zone to deploy to
  - Automatic deployment across zones
  - Example: Azure SQL DB
- Always Available Services
  - Global services, not specific to a region
  - Example: Azure Portal, Azure Active Directory, Azure Front Door

In some cases (Gateway, Load Balancer), we can choose the of zone deployment (zone or zone-redundant).

### Resources and Resource Groups

![Azure Management Groups](./assets/azure_management_groups.jpg)

Azure distinguishes hierarchically between:

- Resources: generic Azure service, the actual things that perform the work, e.g., VM, Storage Unit, DB, etc.
  - They are named
  - We can create them in the portal, CLI, etc.
  - Region is generally necessary
  - A resource has a unique subscription, where its cost is managed
- Resource Groups: a logical group of resources, like a folder/container structure
  - Usually they belong to a region, but the resources inside can be from other regions
  - Recommendation: all resources should be linked, e.g., when one is deleted, all should be deleted, when one is deployed, all should, etc.
  - One resource must belong to one resource group.
  - Permissions can be assigned to groups.
  - Any resource can access any other resource in another resource group; so there is no boundary implicitly implemented.
- Subscriptions
- Management Groups

### Subscriptions

Resource groups belong to **Subscriptions**. Subscriptios are **billing units**. User can have access to several subscriptions and have different roles in them.

There are different types of subscriptions:

- Free plan
- Pay as you go
- Enterprise Agreement (EA)
- Free credits

Big organizations have different subscriptions; usually, each subscription is for a different business unit; that makes easier:

- To manage billing between different business units.
- To manage security; e.g., marketing should not be able to access engineering.

### Management Groups

The subscriptions belong to **Management Groups**; the groups can also belong to other groups.

![Azure Subscription Management](./assets/azure_subscription_management.jpg)

We can assing different policies to different groups; that enhances security.

## 5. Compute and Networking

*Compute* means executing in the cloud.

Compute services covered:

- Virtual Machines (VM)
- VM Scale Sets (VMSS)
- App services (Web apps)
- Azure Container Instances (ACI)
- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Windows Virtual Desktop

Virtual Machines (VM): The most basic compute

- IaaS
- Full control over it: OS, HW, etc.
- It is virtual, not physical
- AWS equivalent: EC2
- We have over 700 VM tyoes, depending on CPU speed, core, RAM, disk size, etc.

VM Scale Sets (VMSS):

- Two or more VMs running the same code, with a load balancer in front to randomly direct traffic to one of the machines.
- Example: website.
- We can add/remove machines (autoscaling); **elasticity**.
- We can handle up to 100 VMs in a scale set, and can be configuerd to handle 1000

App services (Web apps):

- Cloud-native approach to running code: we upload our code + configuration and Azure runs it.
- No access/configuration of the underlying HW.
- PaaS

Azure Container Instances (ACI) & Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

- Another new paradigm for running code.
- Fastest and easiest to deploy.
- Three main containers:
  - Azure Container Instances (ACI): single instance
  - Azure Container Apps: service with several containers beneath; like an App service, but with features of a Kubernetes cluster.
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): cluster of servers; most complicated.

Azure Windows Virtual Desktop:

- Desktop windows running on the Cloud.
- We access it viw the browser: we log in and everything is installed.

## 12. Demos

First, create an Azure account; I created one with the Github credentials.

After that, we basically open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Create a Virtual Machine (Appetizer)

This very simple demo shows how easy it is to create a VM in Azure.

In [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), look for `Virtual Machines`: Create, Fill in form: 

    Basics
        Location
        Resource Group
        Name
        Operating System
        Security Type
        VM architecture: Windows, Linux
        Spot instances: free VMs assigned, but can also be evicted (cheaper)
        Size
        Username, Password (if Windows VM)
        Inbound Ports: SSH (Linux), RDP (WIndows), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
    Disk
        Hard Disk: SSD, etc.
    Networking
        Virtual Network
        Subnet
        Public IP
        Load balancers
        ...
    Management
        Antivirus
        Auto-shutdown
        Backups
        OS Updates
    Monitoring
        OS dignostics
    Advanced
        ...
    Tags
        Phone number, etc.

Finally, we review, create and deploy it.

Then, we can connect to it (RDP, SSH); open the VM resource in the Azure Portal and click on the `Connect` button for more information.

A standard VM costs around 17 cents/h; however, it's charged by the second.
