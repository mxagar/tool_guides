# A Guide to Azure with Focus on Machine Learning

These notes collect the basics related to using the Azure cloud services.

Some of them were written after following the Udemy tutorial/course by Scott Duffy

[AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Prep](https://www.udemy.com/course/az900-azure/)

That tutorial prepares students for the [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/exams/az-900/).

First, create an Azure account; I created one with the Github credentials.

After that, we basically open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

### Create a Virtual Machine (Appetizer)

This very simple demo shows how easy it is to create a VM in Azure.

In [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), look for `Virtual Machines`: Create, Fill in form: 

    Basics
        Location
        Resource Group
        Name
        Operating System
        Security Type
        VM architecture: Windows, Linux
        Spot instances: free VMs assigned, but can also be evicted (cheaper)
        Size
        Username, Password (if Windows VM)
        Inbound Ports: SSH (Linux), RDP (WIndows), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
    Disk
        Hard Disk: SSD, etc.
    Networking
        Virtual Network
        Subnet
        Public IP
        Load balancers
        ...
    Management
        Antivirus
        Auto-shutdown
        Backups
        OS Updates
    Monitoring
        OS dignostics
    Advanced
        ...
    Tags
        Phone number, etc.

Finally, we review, create and deploy it.

Then, we can connect to it (RDP, SSH); open the VM resource in the Azure Portal and click on the `Connect` button for more information.

A standard VM costs around 17 cents/h; however, it's charged by the second.
